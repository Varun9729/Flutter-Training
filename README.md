Practicing the art of BLOC in this repository

## Notes on things that bother

I ran into an issue with understanding streams. Particularly this code block from the Timer example in the BLOC documentation

I have no idea what *Stream.periodic* is or what it does?

Nitish Kumar Singh has an [article](https://medium.com/flutter-community/understanding-streams-in-flutter-dart-827340437da6) to help understand the concept and usage of streams. Will be implementing the dart scripts with inline comments in a folder in this repository as practice.

Per the article this should end with a Flutter application demonstrating the aforementioned concepts.
